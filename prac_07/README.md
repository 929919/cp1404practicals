# Practical 07
# Practical Repository

Welcome to my practicals repository for CP1404. This repository contains all of the programming exercises, projects, and lessons I have worked on throughout the course. It is organized by practicals (e.g., prac_01, prac_02) for easy navigation.

## About Me

My name is João, and I am currently learning programming through the CP1404 course. This repository serves as a record of my learning journey and the various exercises I have completed along the way.

## Key Lessons on Clean Code

Here are three important lessons I have learned about clean code:

- **Simplicity is key**: Writing clean and simple code not only makes it easier for others to read and understand but also improves the maintainability of the codebase.
  
- **Consistent naming conventions**: Using descriptive and consistent variable and function names is essential for making the code more understandable to both current and future developers.
  
- **Avoid repetition (DRY principle)**: The Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle encourages creating reusable code to prevent redundancy, which reduces the chance of bugs and improves the efficiency of the code.

## Resources

- https://github.com/CP1404/Starter/wiki/Programming-Patterns - A comprehensive guide to programming patterns that I have referenced throughout this course.
- https://github.com/CP1404/Practicals.git - The official repository for CP1404 practical instructions, where I followed the guidelines for my exercises.
