# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Honestly, my estimates were kinda all over the place at first. I’d think a task would take an hour and then spend three! But I got the hang of it for simpler stuff as the weeks went by.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

I started getting better when I paid attention to patterns. Like, if a task involved file reading, I knew it’d take extra time to debug. I stopped being super optimistic and added a buffer for surprises, which helped a lot.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learned that estimating is like making an educated guess. Breaking tasks into smaller chunks made it easier to figure out timings. Also, I realized there’s always *something* that goes wrong, so it’s smart to plan for that.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

Getting reviewed felt awkward at first, like “did I mess up that bad?” But it was actually super helpful. People pointed out stuff like unclear variable names, and it made me think more about writing readable code.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

Reviewing others’ code was like holding up a mirror. I spotted mistakes I’d make too, like forgetting error checks. It also taught me to give feedback nicely—nobody likes feeling picked on, right?

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

[Pull Request #42 - Prac 7 Review](https://github.com/Junbinyap/cp1404practicals)

### Explanation

I think this review was solid because I suggested a cleaner way to write a loop using a list comprehension. I also asked the person why they chose their approach first, which made the convo feel more like teamwork than just me pointing stuff out.

### Good Code Review 2

[Pull Request #57 - Prac 8 Review](https://github.com/mayur-ramesh/cp1404practicals)

### Explanation

This one went well because I caught a missing error handler and suggested a try-except block. I explained why it mattered and threw in a quick example. Felt like I was clear and actually added value without sounding nitpicky.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

If I were running things, I’d add more worked examples before each prac. Sometimes we’d get a task and feel lost on where to start. A sample solution with comments would’ve given us a better kickoff, especially early on.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I’m kinda proud of how I kept my code organized—small functions, clear names, that sorta thing. Also, I got better at testing everything before submitting, which saved me from some embarrassing bugs. Feels good!
